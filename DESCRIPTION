Description: Macarron is a workflow for the prioritization of potentially bioactive
    metabolites from metabolomics experiments. Prioritization integrates strengths of 
    evidences of bioactivity such as covariation with a known metabolite, abundance
    relative to a known metabolite and association with an environmental or phenotypic
    indicator of bioactivity. Broadly, the workflow consists of stratified clustering
    of metabolic spectral features which co-vary in abundance in a condition, transfer
    of functional annotations, estimation of relative abundance and differential abundance
    analysis to identify associations between features and phenotype/condition.
